# United-States-Covid19-Map

Covid19 Tracker uses the latest data to display visually the progression of the COVID-19 In the united states. 
The project contains two maps, the first map displays the general trend for the spread of the virus, the second map displays the spread of the virus by county.

D3 gives you the advantage to build almost anything when it comes to charts maps or any other visualization, 
the main challenge that I faced building this project was the data mapping and update patterns, 
the county data file contains more than 400k data points that have to be updated any time the date changes.

Coloring scales for hot zones were also a challenge, but I came up with a very interesting solution, for details on the implementation checkout the prject files.
Each map has zooming capabilities, so I added an info tab that when hover in any of the counties displays the exact information.
